# Customer Support NLP/LLM Pipeline

A production-ready **end-to-end NLP pipeline** for customer support automation.  
This system integrates **intent classification, complaint summarization, and response generation** into a unified workflow.

## 🚀 Features
- **Intent Classification** (DistilBERT fine-tuned on Banking77, ~89% acc/F1).
- **Summarization** (Flan-T5 + LoRA on CFPB consumer complaints).
- **Reply Generation** (Flan-T5 + LoRA on Twitter customer care data).
- Modular design with **src/** codebase (not just notebooks).
- Ready for **deployment & extension**.

## 🖥️ Usage

Run the full pipeline from the command line:

```bash
python main.py "My card hasn’t arrived yet, can I track delivery?"
```

Example output:

```
--- PIPELINE OUTPUT ---
Query: My card hasn’t arrived yet, can I track delivery?
