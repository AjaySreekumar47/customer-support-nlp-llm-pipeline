# Documentation

This folder contains supporting material for the project.

- **architecture.mmd**: Mermaid diagram source.
- **architecture.png**: Exported diagram (if generation succeeds).
- **evaluation.md**: Model metrics and insights.

Note: GitHub now natively renders Mermaid diagrams in Markdown, so `architecture.mmd` is always viewable.
